//Sidebar
--Fixed sidebar toggle not working.
--UI improvements in groups for accordion stucture
--added cogs to plants listed under groups
--Keep dropdown open on element click.
--Removed some unnecessary js
--Replaced plus "+" symbol with bootstrap glyphicon
--removed background color from most <a> tag elements, use white hover text instead
--Made it to where only one dropdown can be active at a time.
--Fixed the dreaded white background bug

WIP
--Create new expanded settings pages for plants/groups
--get accordion settings to work with cogs within groups, probably would be easier to do popups because this is taking me a while to figure out.
